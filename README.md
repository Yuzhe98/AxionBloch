# AxionBloch
A python package for simulating **axion**-induced spin dynamics based on **Bloch equations**, implemented in **Python**  and **C++**.

## Features

In AxionBloch, the axion (including axionlike-particle or ALP) field acts like a **pseudomagnetic field** coupling to (nuclear) spins.

The package provides a **numerical platform** to study these subtle effects using Bloch-equation-based simulations efficiently.

## Installation

```python 
git clone https://github.com/Yuzhe98/AxionBloch.git
```
